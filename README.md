## Overview
### Description
Tracks what music an individual listens to, and pairs them with others based on that music. Could be potentially used as a dating app, or just meeting new friends with similar music tastes.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** News
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into subscriptions.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
